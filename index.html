                        <h4>InstantHedge</h4>
                        <small>Original InstantHedge units range from
                            3 feet to 6 feet tall. Each unit is 40 inches
                            long and contains 4 plants. Each unit weighs
                            around 250 lbs as they are field grown and
                            harvested with native soil around the roots.
                            They come in biodegradable cardboard
                            boxes that can be planted with the hedge.
                            We sell them in sets of 3, which gives you a
                            10 linear foot run of hedge. This size is great
                            for creating privacy hedges and garden rooms.</small>

                            inches long and contains
                            5 plants. Each unit weighs under 40 lbs as they are
                            container grown. They come
                            in plastic pots. This size is
                            great for creating low hedges, borders, and knot gardens</small>

                    You will be notified when your order ships. Sometimes a tracking number will be available, but
                    sometimes there won’t be
                    one. If it is shipping on pallets, you will also be contacted by the shipping company to schedule a
                    delivery
                    appointment. Please be ready to answer calls from unknown numbers when your delivery time is close,
                    as these shipping
                    companies don’t
                    always leave voicemails and they will need to speak to you directly to schedule the appointment.
                    Failure to answer their
                    calls may result in delivery delays. <br><br>
                    Since the pallets are around 1000 lbs each, the carrier will unload the pallets from the truck using
                    a lift gate and a
                    pallet jack. They will leave the pallets on the nearest paved surface, like a sidewalk or driveway,
                    but the pallet jacks
                    cannot go over gravel, pavers, brick, or grass. Please arrange for other help to move the hedges
                    into their final
                    location on your property. <br><br>
                    IMPORTANT - Shipping timing is not an exact science. We can try to hit a certain window of days for
                    delivery, but
                    factors out of our control can always cause delays. Please wait until you
                    have a delivery appointment scheduled with the shipping company to set a day for labor help.
                    <br><br>
                    Optimum shipping times are September-November and January-May.

                        MiniHedges are lightweight and easy to install yourself. Simply dig a trench to the required
                        length, 7 inches deep, and
                        12 inches wide. Lift the hedge units from their pots and place them
                        end to end in the trench. Backfill, mulch over the root zone, and water well.

                    InstantHedges weigh around 250 lbs each, so you will need help planting them. Two or three
                    strong people can move these
                    around by hand, but a small tractor with forks will make things
                    easier. If moving by hand, a couple of hay hooks provide convenient handles. Dig the trench 12
                    inches deep by 18 inches
                    wide to your required length, and lower the hedge units, cardboard
                    and all, into the trench. Make sure they are placed end to end nice and snug to avoid gaps. Then
                    backfill, mulch over
                    the root zone, and water well.

                            Irrigating your hedge is extremely easy if you set up a drip hose on a timer. Make sure to
                            water well for the first
                            couple of years as the hedge gets established. Water deeply 1-2 times per
                            week, especially in dry periods. You want the soil to be moist but not soggy.

                            Apply a slow release fertilizer once per <br> year in early spring to feed the hedge through
                            the
                            growing season.

                            Pruning frequency will depend on your desired size and hedge variety. Faster growing hedges
                            like Green Giant will need
                            to be pruned 2-3 times per year, while slower growers like
                            Emerald Green need it only once. You can use electric trimmers or handheld pruners, but make
                            sure the blades are very
                            sharp.
